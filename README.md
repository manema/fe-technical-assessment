## Frontend Technical Assessment 🚀

### Overview

We want to see your skills with React and TypeScript. You'll be given a Figma design to replicate in a Vite project using Tailwind CSS. Plus, you'll use an AirOps app to fetch and display data.

### What You'll Do
1. **Fork the Repo**: You'll get a barebones Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project. Fork it and get started.
2. **Design Implementation**: Copy the Figma design into your project. Make it look as close as possible.
3. **Data Integration**: Create and use an AirOps App to fetch data and display it! 📊

> Note: if you need to do any create, edit or delete, it doesn’t need to persist anywhere outside of the React state.

### Time Frame
Try to finish within 3 hours. ⏰

### What We Care About
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-structured code. 💻
- **Design Accuracy**: Your app should look like the Figma design. 🎨
- **Functionality**: Your app should fetch and display data correctly. 🔄

### How to Submit

4. Share the link to your repo with us. 📤
